I chose [Bottle](https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/) framework, because it really suits to the task: 
# Pros

## Simplicity and availability
This framework is very easy to start coding, well-written documentation

## Speed
Its much faster then most of other big frameworks due to its size

# Cons
Only api-framewrok, that can suit most of the situations, faster then django

## Not really expendable
Django will be more suitable for medium and big apps because of orm

## Community
Much smaller then django community

# Conclusion
This framework is completely suitable for my educational purposes

# Best practices

## Linter
I installed linter to ensure it's a valid Python code and follow recommended Python-code style.
